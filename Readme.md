This repository contains the MATLAB files to reproduce the data and figures from 'Global bifurcation of localised 2D patterns emerging from spatial heterogeneity' by Dan J. Hill, David J.B. Lloyd and Matthew R. Turner (2025).

A copy of the paper can be found here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02867](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02867)

For the numerical continuation of localised dihedral patterns in the planar quadratic-cubic Swift-Hohenberg equation with a spatial heterogeneity, see the folder 'Continuation'.

For reproducing figures regarding the linear stability of the trivial state, see the folder `Stability'.
